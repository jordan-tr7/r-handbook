# Introduction
---

This reference is inspired by lessons learned during my work for MEMIC as a B.I. Analyst. Open-source programming languages are a great tool in our line of work because they can be quickly developed, handle common steps in our workflow like data cleaning/pre-processing, offer flexibility in how we can approach and solve problems, and have low/no cost or licensing barriers. 

This reference has multiple sections that compose two parts. The first part outlines the fundamentals of programming tools such as variables, conditional statements, functions, etc., and shows examples of how these are implemented in R. The second part shows more practical implementations, such as connecting to a data source using an ODBC connection, functions for handling certain data types at MEMIC, etc. 

Open-source languages like R and Python can be used for anything from conducting a one time exploratory data analysis, to creating an automated report to have sent on a regular cadence. For this reason, these languages are an important part of the future of BI work at MEMIC.

### Note Re: Computational Thinking

There are many different models and strategies for solving problems. Some involve breaking processes down into smaller and smaller chunks, and others like Object Oriented Programming involve thinking about the objects in your program and what needs to be done with them.
